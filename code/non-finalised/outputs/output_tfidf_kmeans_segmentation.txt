Chunk 1:  When Allah wants you to get something, to achieve something or to give you something, nobody can stop it.

Chunk 2: When you are fulfilling salah, when you dress in a specific way, your child who cannot yet speak in your language, who cannot yet communicate properly in your own system will fight to dress the way you dress just because that is the plan of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. I can show them the way to say, look, this is the way.

Chunk 3: Subhanallah. Subhanallah.

Chunk 4: وَعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعَتْ عَلَىٰ أَنْ يَنفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ لَمْ يَنفَعُوكَ إِلَّا بِمَا قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللَّهُ لَكَ Oh, لن ينفعوكَ إِلَّا بِمَا قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللَّهُ لَكَ If the whole nation gets together to benefit you, they won't be able to benefit you except with that which Allah has written for you. Allah says, we will return him to you. Never underestimate the power of Allah. The guidance in the sense that to bring them onto the path is from Allah. May Allah bring our children on the path and before that, may Allah bring us on the path and keep us steadfast.

Chunk 5: The mother would suckle, spend some time, etc, etc.

Chunk 6: Even if the whole world is trying to block you from achieving something, they won't be able to do it. They were spies all over. They didn't hear, they didn't witness, they didn't see. We will make him a messenger. Absolutely innocent. Totally. And cut a long story short. They looked after Musa alayhi salatu was salam until he grew quite old. He would be brought to the mother. And he suckled from no one else. Pray hard. Pray with conviction. If it is good for you, and if it is meant for you, it's in coming in your direction. If it is not, no matter what, it won't. You need to turn back. It's never too late. We're breathing. Take a look at the world. Learn by looking at the globe. Watch the people. See the most content people are not those who run behind materialistic items. Remember that. Wallahi, I promise you. Yes, you might look at glamour. You might look at popularity. You might look at someone who the world looks at as wow, a superhero. Someone who's a movie star in real life. They are depressed. They are struggling. They are bipolar. Look at so many of these pop stars popping one after the other. Pop, pop, pop, pop. Have you seen that? That's why they're called pop stars. We need to serve Allah so that at least in our progeny when they watch us, do you know the most powerful way of relaying the message is for them to follow by example. Why? Did you talk to them? No. I looked after my children up to a certain age. An example, just an example. It's between you and them. But when you follow your faith, considering it a burden, yes, you may be following, but you will not achieve the true benefit of the entire package. I'm scared. Agree? Whether it's your child after a divorce, whether it is someone prior to divorce, maybe your husband had to go and work somewhere, maybe you had to go somewhere, maybe something happened, you were separated for some reason. Sometimes the separation is caused by a third party intentionally. The story of Musa alayhi salatu was salam, the lessons, the ayat, the lessons we learn, it consoles those who are separated from their loved ones saying, inna raddu ilaik, we will definitely return him to you. Do you know that? You need to try to earn the pleasure of Allah. You did it. Your children did it. You tried your best.

Chunk 7: He's going to have something big. Who am I to start with? The same applies to the brothers.

Chunk 8: And Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala inspired his mother to do something unique, to put him into a little casket or a basket, and to put him or literally to cast him into the Nile, into the river, cast him into the river. Inspiration from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. She was chosen to be the mother of a messenger of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. May Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala forgive us.

Chunk 9: If you fulfill your salah constantly, your child will be found in sujood before they can even walk. When you fulfill salah, you're lazy to do it.

Chunk 10: Don't worry.
