Chunk 1: وَعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعَتْ عَلَىٰ أَنْ يَنفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ لَمْ يَنفَعُوكَ إِلَّا بِمَا قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللَّهُ لَكَ Oh, لن ينفعوكَ إِلَّا بِمَا قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللَّهُ لَكَ If the whole nation gets together to benefit you, they won't be able to benefit you except with that which Allah has written for you. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is telling us that if the entire ummah, the whole nation gets together to harm you, they will never be able to inflict any harm upon you unless Allah has written it against you. Look at this man, young baby, born, Fir'aun looking, searching, his men were everywhere. They didn't hear, they didn't witness, they didn't see. And Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala inspired his mother to do something unique, to put him into a little casket or a basket, and to put him or literally to cast him into the Nile, into the river, cast him into the river. How can I do that? Don't worry. Subhanallah. Inspiration from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Subhanallah. Subhanallah. And what happened? Absolutely innocent. Totally. And they were desperate to get him to suckle because he needed to survive. Until subhanallah. Subhanallah. Subhanahu wa ta'ala. Pray to him. Pray hard. Pray with conviction. Remember that. So Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says, We returned him to his mother in order for her eyes to be cooled and for her not to be saddened. She was close to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. She was chosen to be the mother of a messenger of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Imagine what qualities she had. That's what it is. You know, Allah can do it. You need to turn back. It's never too late. We turn to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. It's not too late. We're breathing. Watch the people. Remember that. They are depressed. They are struggling. They are bipolar. Look at so many of these pop stars popping one after the other. Pop, pop, pop, pop. Why? No. But now they're independent. It's up to them now. It's between you and them. Subhanallah. One is to show them the way. I'm scared. Okay, fair enough. Amazing. Agree? Don't worry. May Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala forgive us.

Chunk 2: Allah says, we will return him to you. And the wife, as she was walking, she notices this little casket, and she picks up this baby. And cut a long story short. The mother would suckle, spend some time, etc, etc. And he suckled from no one else. My brothers and sisters, we turn to Allah. See the most content people are not those who run behind materialistic items. If you fulfill your salah constantly, your child will be found in sujood before they can even walk. Did you talk to them? One is الدلال والإرشاد. Your salah may be done. If Musa alayhi salam's mother was told that by Allah, I'm sure Allah can return to us our loved ones. May Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala unite us with our loved ones. Your children did it. When you lose a loved one through death, it's not the end of the path.

Chunk 3: Take him and place him in the water, in the river. Allah will return him to you. He's going to have something big. They were looking for this male child. He would be brought in the highest form of luxury. He would be brought to the mother. When the time is right, what you want will come to you. I always tell the sisters and even the brothers that if you want a child who's going to be someone serving the deen, ask yourself, who am I to start with? Learn by looking at the globe. My brothers and sisters, we need to serve the ummah. I will still guide them. Ya Allah, guide them. I don't want to be punished. I'm going to fulfill this salah because I want to do it for your sake. Sometimes the separation is caused by a third party intentionally. On condition that you all believed. You're going to be united. By the will of Allah, you will meet them again very soon.

Chunk 4: They suffer with problems. We need to serve Allah so that at least in our progeny when they watch us, do you know the most powerful way of relaying the message is for them to follow by example. When you are fulfilling salah, when you dress in a specific way, your child who cannot yet speak in your language, who cannot yet communicate properly in your own system will fight to dress the way you dress just because that is the plan of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Do you know that? What they do beyond a certain age becomes between them and Allah. Once you arrive at a certain point, it's now your life. An example, just an example. I'm not talking about myself, but I'm saying if I look after my children for a certain age up to a certain age, beyond that, if they end up dwindling left and right, I can always say, Ya Allah, I offered them the best. I still make dua for them. I can show them the way to say, look, this is the way. You're just doing it because, hey, you know what? I want to draw another lesson for us all. Do you know that? Allah says, we will gather you together. May Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala grant that to us and may we meet them in a better place, not in a worse place.

Chunk 5: And the opposite also is in the same hadith. The one who made him will look after him. The one who made him will look after him. Allah says, Al-Qi-hi fi al-yam wa la ta-khafi wa la tahzani Inna raddu ilayki wa ja'ilu min al-mursaleen Instruction from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. And we will make him from amongst those who is sent. We will make him a messenger. He was not suckling from anyone because that was the plan of Allah. Look after him, breastfeed him, whatever else, and send him back. The same applies to the brothers. Every night you're in the club, you know, jumping and dancing and drinking and everything else and womanizing and all of those nature of things, you know, that type of thing. Subhanallah, subhanallah, your sheikh is in the night club. Take a look at the world. Yes, you might look at glamour. You might look at popularity. You might look at someone who the world looks at as wow, a superhero. Someone who's a movie star in real life. May Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala help us.

Chunk 6:  When Allah wants you to get something, to achieve something or to give you something, nobody can stop it. They were spies all over. When he wants to give you, he will give you. If I'm a person who wants to follow the trends of today and I have my little heels and my makeup and my mini skirt and I'm walking around with a little handbag, throwing things behind my back like this. Do you want a child who's going to really be some form of, you know, service to the deen? Wallahi, I promise you. They have addiction sometimes to various things, even drugs. I can try when I say I can guide them and Allah guides them two different types of guidance. But التوفيق is from Allah. Remember, when you follow your faith, considering it and honor to follow your faith, that is when you have achieved something. But when you follow your faith, considering it a burden, yes, you may be following, but you will not achieve the true benefit of the entire package. But if you want to achieve the broader benefits of that beautiful salah, do it as an honor.

Chunk 7: If Allah has written it against you, you need to know nothing is going to stop it. But you need to repent. It was Allah's way of telling you, look, if you are good, inshallah, by the will of Allah, they will have a good upbringing. The guidance in the sense that to bring them onto the path is from Allah. Oh Allah, I love you. Allah speaks about how He will allow your family members to join you in the hereafter on condition that you all believed. You need to try to earn the pleasure of Allah. You tried your best.

Chunk 8: And then you say, Oh Allah, make my child a big, you know, sheikh who's going to be spreading the deen. And you want your child to be the sheikh spreading the deen. Have you seen that? That's why they're called pop stars. We need to have a concern for the next generations. May Allah bring our children on the path and before that, may Allah bring us on the path and keep us steadfast. You've given me so much, Ya Allah. My brothers and sisters, getting back to the Pharaoh, Musa alayhi salatu was salam brought up in this home, going back to his mother. Sometimes we are separated from our loved ones. The story of Musa alayhi salatu was salam, the lessons, the ayat, the lessons we learn, it consoles those who are separated from their loved ones saying, inna raddu ilaik, we will definitely return him to you. Sometimes we are separated through death. Death has separated me from my loved one, for example, or a child or a parent or a brother, sibling, someone you really care for, you really love, don't worry.

Chunk 9: Even if the whole world is trying to block you from achieving something, they won't be able to do it. May Allah protect us all. Allah did not bless the Pharaoh with children. And the baby was absolutely gorgeous. This is the power of Allah. Never underestimate the power of Allah. If it is good for you, and if it is meant for you, it's in coming in your direction. She was a good woman. People fulfill salah. When you fulfill salah, you're lazy to do it. You did it.

Chunk 10: They looked after Musa alayhi salatu was salam until he grew quite old. Amazingly, Allah returned the baby as a baby, as an infant to the mother. If it is not, no matter what, it won't. Who am I to start with? I looked after my children up to a certain age. They are doing things. Whether it's your child after a divorce, whether it is someone prior to divorce, maybe your husband had to go and work somewhere, maybe you had to go somewhere, maybe something happened, you were separated for some reason. A matter of time.
