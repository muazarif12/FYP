Chunk 1:   When Allah wants you to get something , to achieve something

Chunk 2: or to give you something , nobody can

Chunk 3: stop it .

Chunk 4: Even

Chunk 5: if the whole world is trying to block you from achieving something , they wo n't

Chunk 6: be able to do it .

Chunk 7: وَعْلَمْ أَنَّ

Chunk 8: الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعَتْ

Chunk 9: عَلَىٰ أَنْ يَنفَعُوكَ

Chunk 10: بِشَيْءٍ لَمْ يَنفَعُوكَ إِلَّا بِمَا قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللَّهُ لَكَ Oh ,

Chunk 11: لن ينفعوكَ إِلَّا بِمَا قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللَّهُ لَكَ

Chunk 12: If the whole nation gets together to benefit you , they wo n't

Chunk 13: be able to benefit you except with that which Allah has written for you .

Chunk 14: And the opposite also

Chunk 15: is in the same hadith .

Chunk 16: The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is

Chunk 17: telling us

Chunk 18: that

Chunk 19: if the entire ummah , the whole nation gets together to harm you , they will never be able to inflict any harm upon you

Chunk 20: unless Allah has written it against you .

Chunk 21: If Allah has written it against you , you

Chunk 22: need to know nothing is going to stop it .

Chunk 23: May Allah

Chunk 24: protect us all .

Chunk 25: Look at this man , young baby , born , Fir'aun looking , searching , his men

Chunk 26: were everywhere .

Chunk 27: They

Chunk 28: were spies all over .

Chunk 29: They did n't hear , they did n't witness , they did n't

Chunk 30: see .

Chunk 31: And Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala

Chunk 32: inspired his mother to do something unique , to put him into a little casket

Chunk 33: or a basket ,

Chunk 34: and to put him

Chunk 35: or literally to cast him into the Nile , into the river , cast him into the river .

Chunk 36: How can I

Chunk 37: do that ?

Chunk 38: Do n't

Chunk 39: worry .

Chunk 40: The one who made him will

Chunk 41: look after him .

Chunk 42: Subhanallah .

Chunk 43: The one who made him will

Chunk 44: look after him .

Chunk 45: Allah

Chunk 46: says , Al - Qi - hi fi al - yam wa la ta - khafi wa la tahzani Inna raddu ilayki

Chunk 47: wa ja'ilu min al - mursaleen Instruction from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala .

Chunk 48: Inspiration from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala .

Chunk 49: Take him

Chunk 50: and place him in the water , in the river .

Chunk 51: Allah will

Chunk 52: return him to you .

Chunk 53: Allah

Chunk 54: says , we will return him to you .

Chunk 55: Subhanallah .

Chunk 56: And we will

Chunk 57: make him from amongst those who is sent .

Chunk 58: We will

Chunk 59: make him a messenger .

Chunk 60: He 's

Chunk 61: going to have something big .

Chunk 62: Subhanallah .

Chunk 63: And what

Chunk 64: happened ?

Chunk 65: Allah did not

Chunk 66: bless the Pharaoh with children .

Chunk 67: They were

Chunk 68: looking for this male child .

Chunk 69: And the wife ,

Chunk 70: as she was walking , she

Chunk 71: notices this little casket ,

Chunk 72: and she picks up this baby .

Chunk 73: And the baby

Chunk 74: was absolutely gorgeous .

Chunk 75: Absolutely

Chunk 76: innocent .

Chunk 77: Totally .

Chunk 78: And

Chunk 79: cut a long story short .

Chunk 80: They

Chunk 81: looked

Chunk 82: after Musa alayhi salatu was salam

Chunk 83: until he grew quite old .

Chunk 84: He was not

Chunk 85: suckling from anyone

Chunk 86: because that was the plan of Allah .

Chunk 87: And they

Chunk 88: were desperate to get him to suckle

Chunk 89: because he needed to survive .

Chunk 90: Until subhanallah .

Chunk 91: Subhanallah .

Chunk 92: Amazingly , Allah

Chunk 93: returned the baby as a baby , as an infant to the mother .

Chunk 94: He would be

Chunk 95: brought in the highest form of luxury .

Chunk 96: He would be

Chunk 97: brought to the mother .

Chunk 98: The mother would suckle ,

Chunk 99: spend some time , etc , etc .

Chunk 100: Look after him ,

Chunk 101: breastfeed him , whatever else ,

Chunk 102: and send him back .

Chunk 103: And he

Chunk 104: suckled from no one else .

Chunk 105: This

Chunk 106: is the power of Allah .

Chunk 107: Never

Chunk 108: underestimate the power of Allah .

Chunk 109: Subhanahu

Chunk 110: wa ta'ala .

Chunk 111: When he wants to give you , he will

Chunk 112: give you .

Chunk 113: Pray to him .

Chunk 114: Pray hard .

Chunk 115: Pray with conviction .

Chunk 116: When the time is right , what you want will

Chunk 117: come to you .

Chunk 118: Remember that .

Chunk 119: If it is good for you ,

Chunk 120: and

Chunk 121: if it is meant for you , it

Chunk 122: 's in coming in your direction .

Chunk 123: If it is not , no matter what , it

Chunk 124: wo n't .

Chunk 125: So Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says , We

Chunk 126: returned him to his mother in order

Chunk 127: for her eyes to be cooled

Chunk 128: and

Chunk 129: for her not to be saddened .

Chunk 130: She

Chunk 131: was a good woman .

Chunk 132: She

Chunk 133: was close to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala .

Chunk 134: She was

Chunk 135: chosen to be the mother of a messenger of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala .

Chunk 136: Imagine what qualities she had .

Chunk 137: I always

Chunk 138: tell the sisters

Chunk 139: and even the brothers

Chunk 140: that

Chunk 141: if you want a child who 's going to be someone serving the deen , ask yourself , who am I to start with ?

Chunk 142: Who

Chunk 143: am I to start with ?

Chunk 144: If I

Chunk 145: 'm a person who wants to follow the trends of today

Chunk 146: and I have my little heels

Chunk 147: and my makeup

Chunk 148: and my mini skirt

Chunk 149: and I 'm walking around with a little handbag , throwing things behind my back like this .

Chunk 150: Do you

Chunk 151: want a child who 's going to really be some form of , you know , service to the deen ?

Chunk 152: The same

Chunk 153: applies to the brothers .

Chunk 154: Every night you

Chunk 155: 're in the club , you know , jumping

Chunk 156: and dancing

Chunk 157: and drinking

Chunk 158: and everything else

Chunk 159: and womanizing

Chunk 160: and all of those nature of things , you know , that type of thing .

Chunk 161: And then you say , Oh Allah ,

Chunk 162: make my child a big , you know , sheikh who 's going to be spreading the deen .

Chunk 163: Subhanallah , subhanallah , your sheikh

Chunk 164: is in the night club .

Chunk 165: That

Chunk 166: 's what it is .

Chunk 167: And you

Chunk 168: want your child to be the sheikh spreading the deen .

Chunk 169: You know , Allah can

Chunk 170: do it .

Chunk 171: But you

Chunk 172: need to repent .

Chunk 173: You

Chunk 174: need to turn back .

Chunk 175: It

Chunk 176: 's never too late .

Chunk 177: My brothers

Chunk 178: and sisters , we

Chunk 179: turn to Allah .

Chunk 180: We

Chunk 181: turn to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala .

Chunk 182: It

Chunk 183: 's not too late .

Chunk 184: We 're

Chunk 185: breathing .

Chunk 186: Take a look at the world .

Chunk 187: Learn by looking at the globe .

Chunk 188: Watch the people .

Chunk 189: See the most content people

Chunk 190: are not those who run behind materialistic items .

Chunk 191: Remember that .

Chunk 192: Wallahi , I

Chunk 193: promise you .

Chunk 194: Yes , you might

Chunk 195: look at glamour .

Chunk 196: You might

Chunk 197: look at popularity .

Chunk 198: You might

Chunk 199: look at someone who the world looks at as wow , a superhero .

Chunk 200: Someone who 's a movie star in real life .

Chunk 201: They

Chunk 202: are depressed .

Chunk 203: They are

Chunk 204: struggling .

Chunk 205: They

Chunk 206: have addiction sometimes to various things , even drugs .

Chunk 207: They

Chunk 208: suffer with problems .

Chunk 209: They

Chunk 210: are bipolar .

Chunk 211: Look at so many of these pop stars popping one after the other .

Chunk 212: Pop , pop , pop ,

Chunk 213: pop .

Chunk 214: Have you

Chunk 215: seen that ?

Chunk 216: That

Chunk 217: 's why they 're called pop stars .

Chunk 218: May Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala

Chunk 219: help us .

Chunk 220: My brothers

Chunk 221: and sisters , we

Chunk 222: need to serve the ummah .

Chunk 223: We

Chunk 224: need to have a concern for the next generations .

Chunk 225: We

Chunk 226: need to serve Allah

Chunk 227: so

Chunk 228: that at least in our progeny when they watch us , do you know the most powerful way of relaying the message is

Chunk 229: for them to follow by example .

Chunk 230: When you are fulfilling salah , when you dress in a specific way , your child who can not yet speak in your language , who can not yet communicate properly in your own system will

Chunk 231: fight to dress the way you dress just

Chunk 232: because that is the plan of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala .

Chunk 233: If you fulfill your salah constantly , your child will be

Chunk 234: found in sujood

Chunk 235: before they can even walk .

Chunk 236: Do you

Chunk 237: know that ?

Chunk 238: Why ?

Chunk 239: Did you

Chunk 240: talk to them ?

Chunk 241: No .

Chunk 242: It

Chunk 243: was Allah 's way of telling you , look ,

Chunk 244: if you are good , inshallah , by the will of Allah , they will have a good upbringing .

Chunk 245: What they do beyond a certain age

Chunk 246: becomes between them

Chunk 247: and Allah .

Chunk 248: Once you arrive at a certain point , it

Chunk 249: 's now your life .

Chunk 250: I

Chunk 251: looked after my children up to a certain age .

Chunk 252: An

Chunk 253: example , just an example .

Chunk 254: I 'm not

Chunk 255: talking about myself ,

Chunk 256: but I 'm saying

Chunk 257: if I look after my children for a certain age up to a certain age , beyond that ,

Chunk 258: if they end up dwindling left

Chunk 259: and right , I can always say , Ya Allah , I offered them the best .

Chunk 260: I still

Chunk 261: make dua for them .

Chunk 262: I will still

Chunk 263: guide them .

Chunk 264: But now they

Chunk 265: 're independent .

Chunk 266: They are

Chunk 267: doing things .

Chunk 268: It

Chunk 269: 's up to them now .

Chunk 270: It

Chunk 271: 's between you

Chunk 272: and them .

Chunk 273: Ya Allah ,

Chunk 274: guide them .

Chunk 275: Subhanallah .

Chunk 276: I can

Chunk 277: try when I say I can guide them

Chunk 278: and Allah guides them two different types of guidance .

Chunk 279: One

Chunk 280: is الدلال والإرشاد .

Chunk 281: One

Chunk 282: is to show them the way .

Chunk 283: I can

Chunk 284: show them the way to say , look , this is the way .

Chunk 285: But التوفيق

Chunk 286: is from Allah .

Chunk 287: The guidance in the sense

Chunk 288: that to bring them onto the path

Chunk 289: is from Allah .

Chunk 290: May Allah bring our children on the path

Chunk 291: and before that , may Allah

Chunk 292: bring us on the path

Chunk 293: and keep us steadfast .

Chunk 294: Remember , when you follow your faith , considering it

Chunk 295: and honor to follow your faith , that is when you have achieved something .

Chunk 296: But when you follow your faith , considering it a burden , yes , you may be

Chunk 297: following ,

Chunk 298: but you will not achieve the true benefit of the entire package .

Chunk 299: People

Chunk 300: fulfill salah .

Chunk 301: When you fulfill salah , you

Chunk 302: 're lazy to do it .

Chunk 303: You 're just

Chunk 304: doing it

Chunk 305: because , hey , you know what ?

Chunk 306: I

Chunk 307: 'm scared .

Chunk 308: I do n't

Chunk 309: want to be punished .

Chunk 310: Okay ,

Chunk 311: fair enough .

Chunk 312: Your salah may be

Chunk 313: done .

Chunk 314: But

Chunk 315: if you want to achieve the broader benefits of that beautiful salah ,

Chunk 316: do it as an honor .

Chunk 317: Oh Allah , I

Chunk 318: love you .

Chunk 319: I 'm

Chunk 320: going to fulfill this salah

Chunk 321: because I want to do it for your sake .

Chunk 322: You 've

Chunk 323: given me so much , Ya Allah .

Chunk 324: Amazing .

Chunk 325: My brothers

Chunk 326: and sisters , getting back to the Pharaoh , Musa alayhi salatu was salam

Chunk 327: brought up in this home , going back to his mother .

Chunk 328: I

Chunk 329: want to draw another lesson for us all .

Chunk 330: Sometimes we are

Chunk 331: separated from our loved ones .

Chunk 332: Agree ?

Chunk 333: Whether it 's your child after a divorce ,

Chunk 334: whether it is someone prior to divorce , maybe your husband had to go

Chunk 335: and work somewhere , maybe you had to go somewhere , maybe something happened , you were

Chunk 336: separated for some reason .

Chunk 337: Sometimes the separation is

Chunk 338: caused by a third party intentionally .

Chunk 339: The story of Musa alayhi salatu was salam , the lessons , the ayat , the lessons we learn , it consoles those who are separated from their loved ones saying , inna raddu ilaik , we will definitely

Chunk 340: return him to you .

Chunk 341: If Musa alayhi salam 's mother was

Chunk 342: told

Chunk 343: that by Allah , I 'm sure Allah can return to us our loved ones .

Chunk 344: May Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala

Chunk 345: unite us with our loved ones .

Chunk 346: Sometimes we are

Chunk 347: separated through death .

Chunk 348: Do you

Chunk 349: know that ?

Chunk 350: Death has separated me from my loved one , for example ,

Chunk 351: or a child

Chunk 352: or a parent

Chunk 353: or a brother , sibling , someone you really care for , you really love , do n't

Chunk 354: worry .

Chunk 355: Allah

Chunk 356: speaks about how He will allow your family members to join you in the hereafter on condition

Chunk 357: that you all believed .

Chunk 358: On condition

Chunk 359: that you all believed .

Chunk 360: You

Chunk 361: need to try to earn the pleasure of Allah .

Chunk 362: You

Chunk 363: did it .

Chunk 364: Your children

Chunk 365: did it .

Chunk 366: You

Chunk 367: tried your best .

Chunk 368: Allah

Chunk 369: says , we will gather you together .

Chunk 370: Do n't

Chunk 371: worry .

Chunk 372: You 're

Chunk 373: going to be united .

Chunk 374: When you lose a loved one through death , it

Chunk 375: 's not the end of the path .

Chunk 376: By the will of Allah , you will

Chunk 377: meet them again very soon .

Chunk 378: A

Chunk 379: matter of time .

Chunk 380: May Allah

Chunk 381: subhanahu wa ta'ala grant that to us

Chunk 382: and may we meet them in a better place , not in a worse place .

Chunk 383: May Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala

Chunk 384: forgive us .
