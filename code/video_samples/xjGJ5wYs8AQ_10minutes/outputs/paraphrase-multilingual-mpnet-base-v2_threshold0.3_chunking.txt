 When Allah wants you to get something, to achieve something or to give you something, nobody can stop it. Even if the whole world is trying to block you from achieving something, they won't be able to do it. وَعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعَتْ عَلَىٰ أَنْ يَنفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ لَمْ يَنفَعُوكَ إِلَّا بِمَا قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللَّهُ لَكَ Oh, لن ينفعوكَ إِلَّا بِمَا قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللَّهُ لَكَ If the whole nation gets together to benefit you, they won't be able to benefit you except with that which Allah has written for you. And the opposite also is in the same hadith. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is telling us that if the entire ummah, the whole nation gets together to harm you, they will never be able to inflict any harm upon you unless Allah has written it against you. If Allah has written it against you, you need to know nothing is going to stop it. May Allah protect us all.
