 So have you ever wondered what the daily schedule of a productive Muslim CEO that is managing three companies at the same time looks like? Well actually like this and in today's video I'm going to share you step by step how I'm aligning all of my daily responsibilities with the five daily prayers and I mean we have amazing business book about everything but no one is sharing us how to do it as Muslims so in today's video I'm going to share you how I do it in the most efficient way. All right so the first thing that I do when mapping out my whole daily schedule is looking at the most important things first which starts of course with looking at the daily prayers the five obligationary daily prayers that we have to do as a Muslim and our Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said it as well the most beloved by Allah are the ones that are praying on time so the first thing that we should do is looking at when do we have our daily prayers and for me I'm currently staying in Dubai so I mapped out the daily prayer times of Dubai currently but wherever you are this can work I'm doing this schedule when I'm in Amsterdam when I'm traveling when I'm in Dubai right now so it doesn't really matter but the first thing that you should do is look at when do you have to pray and maybe you are asking yourself why is he putting Mahrib on top why is Mahrib the first prayer so I'll come to that in a second so the first thing most important thing is mapping out when do you have to pray the second thing that I do is looking at my sleep because your sleep is also very very important it really provides your energy it is really important to get the right rest everything like that so that's the second most important thing for me so like you can see right over here I also mapped out when I'm going to sleep so between Isha and Fajr of course is the time that we're going to sleep that's the night time and the most important thing for me is that that I at least have between six to eight hours of sleep ideally sometimes when your body really needs it it could be even more sleep is the fundament of everything I'm really seeing nowadays how people are really not taking care of their sleep anymore people are sleeping like four or five hours a night and I'm seeing big entrepreneurs doing this as well but for me it doesn't work for me it's really important to just have the right rest proper rest good qualitative sleep and that's also why my day is mapped out starting from Mahrib it's not only that scientifically it's proven that your morning routine starts in the night what you do in the evening but it's also when you look at the Islamic calendar the day starts after Mahrib so after sunset and when you look at the start of Ramadan for example the start at a new day when you look at the Islamic calendar the day the new day starts after Mahrib so when we map out our whole day we should start looking from Mahrib but in this scenario I will start explaining my whole day from Isha why because what most people do is they start their day in the morning they think that their day is starting with the morning routine you know most entrepreneurs are telling you oh the most important thing is the morning routine but the actual more important thing is your evening routine what do you do before you go to bed and why am I saying that because what you do before you go to bed will determine how you sleep and that will determine what kind of energy you have to have a productive morning routine so let's say for example if you are eating snacks the whole evening you are constantly on your phone you're sleeping very late you have four hours of sleep you are completely tired and low energy and you're going to have a productive morning routine you cannot tell me that you are going to have a productive morning routine if you are not taking care of your evening routine and how much hours you sleep so the first thing that I do is after Isha sometimes I go to the masjid and sometimes I do it at home after Isha I have a couple of rules and this set of rules is actually called the 3-2-1 rule the 3-2-1 rule and it starts actually even between Mahrib and Isha so I will write it down here quickly 3-2-1 rule the 3-2-1 rule actually means three hours before I go to bed I don't eat any food anymore because when you eat a lot of food before you go to bed it takes a lot of energy for your body to process that food because what happens when you go to bed and you eat a lot a lot of food or even a little bit you go to sleep you close your eyes but your body is still working is still processing all of the food everything so it's really bad to eat before you go to bed now two hours before I go to bed I make sure that I don't drink anymore no water nothing and the reason for that is a little bit the same as the three hours no food before you go to bed but the main reason is actually because if you drink before you go to bed the likelihood of you needing to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night is getting higher then one hour before you go to bed no screens what I do is I make sure that there is nothing coming into my brain anymore no tv no netflix no social media no phones no messaging no calls nothing just winding down and taking time and most of the time the three and the two already starts before isha and the one rule so no screens nothing is actually after isha and then in order to know how to structure this rule it's very important that I determine when I need to go to sleep and I do that by looking at all right I want between six to eight hours of sleep and I want to wake up at fadja fadja time currently is 4 30 in the morning 4 30 a.m so normally right now I'm going to sleep between a little bit around 10 o'clock in the night in the evening so that means that I'm having like two hours after isha because isha is at eight so what I do right over here is I'm going to the masjid I'm reading the quran reflecting these are the kinds of activities that I'm doing sometimes go to the masjid of course I'm focusing on my prayer sometimes voluntary extra prayers in the evening it's also very good to just wind down and get into the mood of of going to bed reading quran reading some other books maybe but most of the time it's just quran because all of those business books contain a lot of information that your brain it keeps going crazy so quran is just peaceful it's just really good for your heart for your mind so it's amazing to do that before you go to bed reciting surat al mulk also very important to do before you go to bed so these kinds of things and the are things that I'm doing sometimes I just grab note piece of paper and I'm writing down my thoughts maybe you have noticed that before you go to bed all of the thoughts start running and you cannot sleep that's because you're not taking time to let your thoughts come out you know you're constantly when daytime is there you only thing that you're doing is letting information in when you have some rest you're opening your social media you're scrolling scrolling scrolling scrolling watching Netflix YouTube videos all day like this video this is information that I'm bringing to you this is a lot new information and this is good it's very good that you're watching this video mashallah but it's also important that you take some time sometimes to just write down your thoughts because you are a person that can produce as well do not only consume the whole day because that's also a big reason why people are experiencing stress burnouts even like that it already it all starts by just over stimulating your brain so between isha and bedtime it is very important for me to just wind down and not do anything except from just peaceful things I even have a have some glasses let me see if where it is oh here is it so actually in during this time what I'm wearing are these cool glasses and these glasses are maybe you can see it a little bit when I put it over here when you're looking through these glasses the whole environment turns a little bit red and the reason why the reason why I'm wearing those glasses is because the red the color red is the lowest color in the Kelvin spectrum and this color red stimulates the creation of the hormone melatonin and melatonin is the hormone in your brain that you need in order to fall asleep so between this no screens because blue light all of these lights during the day you shouldn't have that after sunrise it's very bad for your biological rhythms everything like that it's very bad for your sleep the quality of your sleep and usually it takes a lot of time to fall asleep if you are not taking time to wind down a little bit so that was only the evening routine so one more time the evening routine is the most important thing if you want to have a productive day after that good qualitative sleep then you have the morning so my alarm wakes me up for fadjr and in the morning when I wake up for fadjr the most beautiful thing is to just doodoo fresh up a little bit and go outside to the masjid if there is a masjid nearby I always go if I'm currently staying traveling at a place where I'm not really close to a masjid then I unfortunately have to pray at home but currently here alhamdulillah in Dubai there are a lot of masjids a lot of musks all over the place there's just one here around the corner and it's also really nice to wake up that way because you're catching some fresh air which is very good for your body you're moving a little bit you know so it's easier for your body to wake up so a lot of benefits are for going to the mosque and I'm even speaking about the barakah that's in your morning when you really go to the masjid and you pray together so the first thing like I said is again I go to the masjids and I also do some reading and Quran for me one of the best moments of the day to start learning and memorizing Quran a little bit is also in the morning because your brain is really fresh you know there's not a lot of things in your brain going on so as you already can see the first thing before we're talking about work before we're talking about going to the gym when I'm going to have food the first things is looking at the prayer times and how can I even because I'm having a very busy day I'm having a lot of responsibilities throughout the day but the first thing I try to prioritize is my dean you cannot have a bad day if you already have such blessings in your day you know having quality of the sleep you're full of energy and you end and start your day with Quran with your dean with peace in mind alhamdulillah that's uh that's amazing then the second thing of the day what you're actually seeing is these five lines red lines are the moments of my daily prayers which means you have five moments five parts of your day so the biggest mistake I think that people are making is that throughout the whole day they are very reactive so in the morning they are already answering calls going to the gym in the morning then they're going to have some calls in between they're in the middle in the afternoon they're going to do some extra work and then they're having the family in between and then they're doing this and then like it's a complete chaos like for me the best thing with that works is just dividing my day into these five parts and then the first thing what I do is I dive into some work and not just normal work I go and dive into deep work deep work and the reason why I'm writing this so big is that it's the biggest and most important part of my day so after going to the masjid in the morning I dive into my deep work now what is deep work deep work is a moment of the day where you are working without being distracted so that means like this is my actual computer actually as you can see so when I go come home after my prayer I sit down and I make sure that I don't have any phone with me my phone is not with me so when I come home I sit down behind my desk and I start with deep work I start with deep work and deep work means no distraction and full concentrated work on certain tasks the most important tasks of the day first because the actual goal of having a good and productive day is catching as much wins as possible a win is that I have good sleep a win is that I'll go to the masjid a win is that I read the Quran a win is that I go to the masjid in the morning again and the other win one of the biggest win for me for my company and for my business is doing the most important tasks first and I'll get in a second later at the end of this video what kind of list I'm working on because I do that at the end of the day after maghrib I try to schedule my whole day but I will get into that in a second later on so what I believe is that if you are an entrepreneur and you don't have any deep focus throughout the day then you don't have a productive day you cannot tell me that you have a productive day if you're not deep working especially when you're starting out in the beginning this is all that matters and I'm currently managing three businesses at the same time and to do that if without deep work if you're constantly in meetings how can you do your to-dos it's very very hard so I strive for at least four hours of deep work at least so sometimes like you can see right over here at 10 a.m sometimes right over here I have some meetings and I mean I don't really prefer to have meetings in the morning but sometimes unfortunately it just happens and you have to do that but if I don't have any meetings this just continues I just have the deep work until dohor so that means the time between fajr and dohor is completely dedicated to in the morning going to the masjid but after that I immediately go into work and some people say oh I am more productive in the evening or in the night or whatever but it goes against the whole thing that I said here if you work in the night or if you work in the evening your sleep will be less good and that's the reason why you don't have a productive morning routine the reason why you are not productive in the morning and why you can't be productive in the morning is because you don't have a good evening routine that's the whole reason don't tell me that you cannot do this in the morning everyone can but you just need to make sure that you build your routine around it and let me give you another reason because you don't need to listen to me you need to listen to our prophet sallallahu alayhi wasalam and our prophet sallallahu alayhi he made a dua he made a dua to allah subhanahu wa ta'ala for the people who are being productive in the morning because what he said sallallahu alayhi wasalam he said oh allah bless my ummah in the early mornings so for that reason I also dedicate some time to the quran because those blessings are the best blessings of course but also I try to do my most important things in the morning because that's the moment when our ummah we are blessed our work is blessed we have barakah in what we do and also one other thing for the people that say oh I'm productive in the night when you look into the islamic sources it is also not really recommended to do anything between isha and fajr our prophet sallallahu alayhi wasalam said as well the only reason for staying up is if you're doing that for prayer or reading quran and getting knowledge other than that allah subhanahu wa ta'ala made the day and the night for us to to separate the day so it's not really smart idea to do things in the night in the evening and then after fajr and a productive morning it's time for dohr dohr prayer and at the time of dohr at 1 p.m right over here in dubai it means that I already had a working day of seven hours seven hours at dohr time in the middle of the day I've already worked seven hours and these seven hours are not comparable with the eight hours of a nine-to-five worker why because I'm having deep work and most people in nine-to-five or people at the working at an office they're constantly distracted you know they're constantly having conversations with other people they're getting calls getting phone calls they need to send messages and things like that like people cannot call me in these hours sometimes I'm having meetings but these are pre-scheduled meetings not meetings that get out of nowhere between this so right over here I'm having no phone so this is a phone I'm having no phones you cannot contact me in between this time so that means that these seven hours can be maybe the same as 14 hours of someone who is working in productive you know so in between fajr and dohr I did amazing things I went to the masjid I had productive day I had some meetings if necessary so then it's time for a break I worked hard it's time for a break and if you want to stay sharp sometimes it's good to take a break you have people and entrepreneurs again business owners CEOs that are working from here to there and I mean you can do that but I think the best and most important thing is invest in your health as well invest in your sleep invest in time to the masjid like your mental peace but also to not work like complete 10 hours in a day so then the next thing that I do and that's between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. so that's two hours after duhr I take time for my prayer and then what I'm doing sports taking time for fitness going to the gym things like that plus I'm having a brunch now you might be thinking what is a brunch because I haven't even talked about food yet and you're correct I don't eat I don't eat after I woke up I'm not eating somewhere here I'm just doing something that is called intermittent fasting and intermittent fasting is something that people here in the west in the western world made a very big thing but fasting is very important Islam stimulates it during Ramadan we are obligated to do that we need to do that as Muslims and even our Prophet on Mondays and Thursdays he fasted voluntary which I try to do once in a while as well but it's just very important that we don't eat throughout the whole day I mean our bodies are not meant to eat breakfast are eating lunch snacks in between dinner and then snacks in the evening because your body is constantly processing food I mean we have to learn from nature we have to learn from the creation of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and if people people have existed for millions of years you know millions of years we have evolved we have learned things and throughout this whole period and this tiny part right over here this is the modern world you know where we have fridges where we can put food in a fridge so that it stays good those millions of years before the modern time we didn't have fridge we we were lucky if we had hunted one chicken or one cow one beef you know so sometimes you even needed to spend days without food if you look at the life of our Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam he didn't eat that much food and there's also this hadith about the proportion of food that we need one third of our stomach for food one third for water and one third for air so that means don't fill up your body constantly and that's what we're actually doing people are obese I mean people back in the days we're not obese people right now are not fit not in a good shape not in a good health condition why because we're constantly eating and not only eating we're constantly eating unhealthy food junk food we're still eating before sleep eating in the morning things like that I don't do that I don't do that I'm having brunch which means breakfast and lunch in one brunch it's not something I it's actually a very popular word for people that didn't know brunch and I'm doing that until here I'm taking my time I'm taking my time to go to the gym and it can be different sometimes I'm going to the gym sometimes I'm going for a run sometimes I'm going to play soccer with friends or anything like that I really love sports you know so it's just very important that I I make my body in motion and moving because I'm having a job where I need to do things online we're into marketing software and building all of those things so most part of the day I'm sitting still I'm working behind the screen so for me it's really important that I'm also having a part of my day where my body is in movement where I can go outside where I can play sports anything like that because it's very important to stay in in a healthy good condition you know so I'm taking time for sport about one hour maybe one and a half and then I'm having brunch I'm making sure that I'm going to eat some healthy food and what I'm currently doing already for a couple of months is OMAD OMAD which is one meal a day so I'm just eating one meal a day it's a bigger meal than what people are normally lunching I'm eating like half a kilo of beef or chicken combined with one whole avocado some extra vegetables or things like that five to six eggs so that I'm making sure that after sports I'm filling up my body with proteins with vitamins and all of the necessaries for the for the day and it's not completely that I'm doing OMAD because sometimes after assar I'm having some fruit some nuts some dates throughout the day and I mean I'm a human as well sometimes I want snacks as well but actually let me check somewhere yeah here the best snack that you can have is dates like our Prophet did as well these are containing a lot of healthy things this is coming straight out of nature if you're eating chocolate and all of those things throughout the day then it's really bad for your body you know and what I must realize as well as a CEO you're responsible for not only your company for your money for taking care of your family and take care of your team but it's the most important thing that you take care of yourself if I'm not taking care of myself then how can I do this throughout the day how can I have energy how can I make sure that I'm fit if I'm not fit then I cannot do all of those things I cannot be responsible for my own company if I'm not sleeping well if I'm not prioritizing my deen if I'm not eating healthy then I would constantly have brain fuck I will not be sharp I will not really be able to to make sure that that I be predictive and that I get the right results you know so what I do is called OMAD but sometimes I'm eating some snacks over here and when I'm really fasting for the sake of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala then the OMAD the meal is right over here so sometimes when I'm voluntary fasting the OMAD so the one meal a day is after maghrib after I break my my fast so this schedule is also very easy to adapt if you're fasting even in Ramadan this is a very amazing schedule to use you know so after a quick break I did a shower after sporting I switched my clothes I freshed up I've eaten I've I'm fit I went outside maybe even after going to the gym I'm going for a quick walk I'm completely fresh it feels like a whole new day is about to start after that so then at three and Asr is at four I'm having time I'm having a lot of time between maghrib and Asr and this can be completely different depending on my day but the afternoon can consist of some light work by the way really sorry for my bad head-drying thing because yeah I don't have any excuses I'm sorry so it can be light work it can be meetings it can be brainstorming about new ideas but it can also be time for some fun damn my handwriting is so bad but it can also be time for some fun I mean how can you even write well when you're sitting like this I should buy a board where I'm having more more space okay but it can also be for fun activities time with family or something like that sometimes I'm even taking time to have meetings outside actually my day is open it really depends on my day so I can do take time for some light work sometimes I'm having meetings brainstorming but also I have a lot of time for fun activities or take time for family or things like that and the reason that I can do that is because of this morning because I prioritize all of the important things actually it doesn't really matter what I do after that I see do you see how I prioritize all of the things throughout the day so first I look at the prayer times then I look at my sleep for my energy then I look at how to implement time for my religion for going to the masjid reading Quran all of those things then I try to finish the most important things that I have to do for my work first which I do with deep work then sometimes I'm having meetings then I prioritize my health with sports I'm going to eat healthy I'm going to the gym and then throughout the whole day even before Asr until Isha I have all the time I have all the time to just have fun because sometimes people are thinking as a CEO as an entrepreneur you cannot have fun anymore it's so busy and yes it is very busy I have a lot of responsibilities and sometimes throughout the day I have to work from Asr until Maghrib sometimes I have to do that sometimes even after Maghrib in the evening I'm still working it really happens but even right now for example it is just a little bit after Asr and I'm currently recording a video it doesn't really matter what I do I just do the things that are important sometimes it's taking time for family and things like that after Maghrib what I do is I take time for things like family or time for reading or other activities but it's also very important that I must make sure that the 3-2-1 rule is about to start somewhere over here and the biggest mistake that a lot of people are making and I made it myself as well a bunch of times is that this is going well I'm having an amazing day everything is going well business is running I did all of the things that I have to do and then Maghrib is there and then after that I forget that actually the day is starting then again you know so I'm still on social media or something like that I'm still taking time with family and that is getting late and late and late but you must remember that if you are right over here not taking time for a good routine then the days after that will also not be right alright now let me see did I forget anything there's one thing over here before Isha I plan my whole day so I plan all of this what is about to happen for the next day is I schedule it everything I schedule also my light work or my fun activities or things like that because I need to wake up with purpose let me actually write that purpose the most important thing is that you have purpose in life how can you work on a plan how can you level up every single day if you don't have a plan a normal day starts with a plan good sleep prioritizing your Dean and then you have it the most productive routine that I have ever seen and this is not something that I just did out of nowhere this is after a couple of years of optimizing after I referred to Islam I needed to flip the whole schedule as well but this is just by testing and feeling and looking and optimizing about what works best for me and this doesn't mean that you have to do the exact same thing I mean if you're still going to school or if you have a 9 to 5 job it might be very hard to do it like this then I suggest you become an entrepreneur it's much easier to schedule your own time but also maybe you have an own business and where you cannot align it with this maybe you cannot go to the gym in the middle of the day maybe you need to do it in the morning or in the afternoon or in the evening I just shared this video to give you a little bit more of an insight in my days how I do it and I think it can be very valuable for you as well try to learn try to be adaptive and also when you're just starting out really important I'm taking sometimes seven hours of deep work so I'm really working hard between Fajr and Dohor but if you're just starting out it's really hard to concentrate this is something you really have to train so try to implement some of these things step by step if you're just starting out but the goal should be that you do as much as you can in your day while still taking time for your prayers and for Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala go to the masjid and also for your family fun activities if I'm on vacation I can do this because I'm still taking time with family if I'm in a busy period I can do this because I can dedicate my time more for work even after Asr and stuff it doesn't really matter this is it this is it alhamdulillah alhamdulillah so I hope this video is insightful for you if you want to learn more click in the first link here down below because I've got something amazing for you how you can learn these things as well how can you can build your own business set it up in a halal way 100% halal way and then I'll speak to you next time Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh
