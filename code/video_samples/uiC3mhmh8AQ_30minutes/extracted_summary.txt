sentence: So you ever wondered what the daily schedule of a productive Muslim CEO that is managing three companies at the same time looks like? Well actually like this in today's video I'm going to share you step by step how I'm aligning all of my daily responsibilities with the five daily prayers and I mean we have amazing business book about everything but no one is sharing us how to do it as Muslims so in today's video I'm going to share you how I do it in the most efficient way. All right so the first thing that I do when mapping out my whole daily schedule is looking at the most important things first which starts of course with looking at the daily prayers five obligationary daily prayers that we have to do as a Muslim and our Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said it as well the most beloved by Allah are the ones that are praying on time the first thing that we should do is looking at when do we have our daily prayers and for me I'm currently staying in Dubai so I mapped out the daily prayer times of Dubai currently but wherever you are this can work I'm doing this schedule when I'm in Amsterdam when I'm traveling when I'm in Dubai right now so it doesn't really matter but the first thing that you should do is look at when do you have to pray and maybe you are asking yourself why is he putting Mahrib on top why is Mahrib the first prayer so I'll come to that in a second so the first thing most important thing is mapping out when do you have to pray second thing that I do is looking at my sleep because your sleep is also very very important it really provides your energy it is really important to get the right rest everything like that so that's the second most important thing for me so like you can see right over here I also mapped out when I'm going to sleep so between Isha and Fajr of course is the time that we're going to sleep that's the night time the most important thing for me is that at least have between six to eight hours of sleep ideally sometimes when your body really needs it it could be even more sleep is the fundament of everything I'm really seeing nowadays how people are really not taking care of their sleep anymore people are sleeping like four or five hours a night and I'm seeing big entrepreneurs doing this as well but for me it doesn't work for me it's really important to just have the right rest proper rest good qualitative sleep and that's also why my day is mapped out starting from it's not only that scientifically it's proven that your morning routine starts in the night what you do in the evening but it's also when you look at the Islamic calendar the day starts after after sunset and when you look at the start of Ramadan for example the start at a new day when you look at the Islamic calendar the day the new day starts after Mahrib so when we map out our whole day we should start looking from Mahrib but in this scenario I will start explaining my whole day from Isha why because what most people do is they start their day in the morning they think that their day is starting with the morning routine know most entrepreneurs are telling you oh the most important thing is the morning routine but the actual more important thing is your evening routine what do you do before you go to bed and why am saying that because what you do before you go to bed will determine how you sleep and that will determine what kind of energy you have to have a productive morning routine so let's say for example if you are eating snacks the whole evening you are constantly on phone you're sleeping very late you have four hours of sleep you completely tired and low energy and you're going to have a productive morning routine you cannot tell me that you are going to have a productive morning routine if you are not taking care of your evening routine and how much hours you sleep so the first thing that I do is after Isha sometimes I go to the masjid and sometimes I do it at Isha I have a couple of rules and this set of rules is actually called the 3 -2 -1 rule the 3 -2 -1 rule and it starts actually even between Mahrib and Isha so I will write it down here quickly 3 -2 -1 rule the 3 -2 -1 rule actually means three hours before I go to bed I don't eat any food anymore because when you eat a lot of food before you go to bed it takes a lot of energy for your body to process that food because what happens when you go to bed and you eat a lot a lot of food or even a little bit you go to sleep you close your eyes but your body is still working is still processing all of the food everything so it's really bad to eat before you go to bed now two hours before I go to bed I make sure that I don't drink anymore no water nothing the reason for that is a little bit the same as the three hours no food before you go to bed but the main reason is actually because if you drink before you go to bed the likelihood of you needing to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night is getting higher then one hour before you go to bed no screens what I do is I make sure that there is nothing coming into my brain anymore no tv no netflix no social media no phones no messaging no calls nothing just winding down and taking time and most of the time the three and the two already starts before isha and the one rule so no screens nothing is actually after isha and then in order to know how to structure this rule it's very important that determine when I need to go to sleep and I do that by looking at all right I want between six to hours of sleep and I want to wake up at fadja time currently is 4 in the morning 4 30 a .m normally right now I'm going to sleep between a little bit around 10 o 'clock in the night in the evening so that means that I'm having like two hours after isha because isha is at what do right over here is I'm going to the masjid I'm reading the quran reflecting these are the kinds of activities that I'm doing sometimes go to the masjid of course I'm focusing on my prayer sometimes voluntary extra prayers in the evening it's also very good to just wind down and get into the mood of of going to bed reading quran reading some other books maybe but most of the time it's just quran because all of those business books contain a lot of information that your brain it keeps going crazy so quran is just peaceful it's just really good for your heart for your mind so it's amazing to do that before you go to bed reciting surat al mulk also very important to do before you go to bed so these kinds of things and the are things that I'm doing sometimes I just grab note piece of paper and I'm writing down my thoughts you have noticed that before you go to bed all of the thoughts start running and you cannot sleep that's because you're not taking time to let your thoughts come out you know you're constantly when daytime is there you only thing that you're doing is letting information in when you have some rest you're opening your social media you're scrolling scrolling scrolling scrolling watching Netflix YouTube videos all day like this video this is information that I'm bringing to you this is a lot new information and this is good it's very good that you're watching this video mashallah but it's also important that you take some time sometimes to just write down your thoughts because you are a person that can produce as well do not only consume the whole day because that's also a big reason why people are experiencing stress burnouts even like that it already it all starts by just over stimulating your brain so between isha and bedtime it is very important for me to just wind down and not do anything except from just peaceful things even have a have some glasses let me see if where it is oh here is it so actually in during this time what I'm wearing are these cool glasses and these glasses are maybe you can see it a little bit when I put it over here when you're looking through these glasses the whole environment turns a little bit red the reason why the reason why I'm wearing those glasses is because the red the color red is the lowest color in the spectrum and this color red stimulates the creation of the hormone melatonin and melatonin is the hormone in your brain that you need in order to fall asleep between this no screens because blue light all of these lights during the day you shouldn't have that after sunrise it's very bad for your biological rhythms everything like that it's very bad for your sleep the quality of your sleep and usually it takes a lot of time to fall asleep if you are not taking time to wind down a little bit so that was only the evening routine so one more time the routine is the most important thing if you want to have a productive day that good qualitative sleep then you have the morning so my alarm wakes me up for fadjr and in the morning when wake up for fadjr the most beautiful thing is to just fresh up a little bit and go outside to the masjid if there is a masjid nearby I always go if I'm currently staying traveling at a place where I'm not really close to a masjid then I unfortunately have to pray at home but currently here alhamdulillah in Dubai there are a lot of masjids a lot of musks all over the place there's just one here around the corner and it's also really nice to wake up that way because you're catching some fresh air which is very good for your body you're moving a little bit you know so it's easier for your body to wake up so a lot of benefits are for going to the mosque and I'm even speaking about the barakah that's in your morning when you really go to the masjid and you pray together so the first thing like said is again I go to the masjids and I also do some reading and Quran for me one of the best moments of the day to start learning and memorizing Quran a little bit is also in the morning because your brain is really fresh you know there's not a lot of things in your brain going on so as you already can see the first thing before we're talking about work before we're talking about going to the gym when I'm going to have food the first things is looking at the prayer times and how can I even because I'm having a very busy day I'm having a lot of responsibilities throughout the day but the first thing I try to prioritize is my dean you cannot have a bad day if you already have such blessings in your day you know having quality of the sleep you're full of energy and you end and start your day with with your with peace in mind alhamdulillah that's uh that's amazing then the second thing of the day what you're actually seeing is these five lines red lines are the moments of my daily prayers which means you have five moments five parts of your day so the biggest mistake I think that people are making is that throughout the whole day they are very reactive so in the morning they are already answering calls going to the gym in the morning then they're going to have some calls in between they're in the middle in the afternoon they're going to do some extra work and then they're having the family in between and then they're doing this and like it's a complete chaos like for me the best thing that works is just dividing my day into these five parts and then the first thing what I do is I dive into some work and not just normal work I go and dive into deep work deep work and the reason why I'm writing this so big is that it's the biggest and most important part of my day so after going to the masjid in the morning I dive into my deep work now what is deep work work is a moment of the day where you are working without being distracted so that means like this is my actual computer actually as you can see so when I go come home after my prayer I sit down and I make sure that I don't have any phone with me my phone is not with me so when I come home I sit down behind my desk and I start with deep work I start with deep work and deep work means no distraction and full concentrated work on certain tasks most important tasks of the day first because the actual goal of having a good and productive day is catching as much wins as possible a win is that I have good sleep a win is that I'll go to the masjid a win is that I read the Quran a win is that I go to the masjid in the morning again and the other win one of the biggest win for me for my company for my business is doing the most important tasks first and I'll get in a second later at the end of this video what kind of list I'm working on because I do that at the end of the day maghrib I try to schedule my whole day but I will get into that in a second later on so what I believe is that if you are an entrepreneur and you don't have any deep focus throughout the day then you don't have a productive day you cannot tell me that you have a productive day if you're not deep working especially when you're starting out in the beginning this is all that matters and I'm managing three businesses at the same time and to do that if without deep work if you're constantly in meetings how can you do your to -dos it's very very hard so I strive for at least four hours of deep work at least so sometimes like you can see right over here at 10 a .m over here have some meetings I mean I don't really prefer to have meetings in the morning but sometimes unfortunately it just happens and you have to do that but if I don't have any meetings this just continues I just have the deep work until so that means the time between fajr and is completely dedicated to in the morning going to the masjid but after that I immediately go into work and some people say oh I am more productive in the evening or in the night or whatever but it goes against the whole thing that I said here if you work in the night or if you work in the evening your sleep will be less good and that's the reason why you don't have a productive morning routine reason why you are not productive in the morning and why you can't be productive in the morning is because you don't have a good evening routine that's the whole reason don't tell me that you cannot do this in the morning everyone can but you just need to make sure that you build your routine around it and let me give you another reason because you don't need to listen to me you need to listen to our prophet sallallahu alayhi wasalam and our prophet sallallahu alayhi made a dua made a dua to allah subhanahu wa ta 'ala for the people who are being productive in the morning because what he said sallallahu alayhi wasalam he said oh allah bless my ummah in the early mornings so for that reason also dedicate some time to the quran because those blessings are the best blessings of course but also I try to do my most important things in the morning because that's moment when our ummah are blessed our work is blessed we have barakah in what we do and also one other thing for the people that say oh I'm productive in the night when you look into the islamic sources it is also not really recommended to do anything between isha and fajr our prophet sallallahu alayhi said as well the only reason for staying up is if you're doing that for prayer or reading quran and getting knowledge other than that allah subhanahu wa ta 'ala made the day and the night for us to to separate the day so it's not really smart idea to do things in the night in the evening and then after fajr and a productive morning it's time for dohr dohr prayer and at the time of dohr at 1 p .m right over here in dubai it means that already had a working day of seven hours hours at time in the middle of the day I've already worked seven hours and these seven hours are not comparable with the eight hours of a nine -to -five worker why because I'm having deep work and most people in nine -to -five or people at the working at an office they're constantly distracted you know they're constantly having conversations with other people they're getting calls getting phone calls they need to send messages and things like that like people cannot call me in these hours sometimes I'm having meetings but these are pre -scheduled meetings not meetings that get out of nowhere between this so right over here I'm having no phone so this is a phone I'm having no phones you cannot contact me in between this time so that means that these seven hours can be maybe the same as 14 hours of someone who is working in productive you know so in between did amazing things I went to the masjid I had productive day I had some meetings if necessary so then it's time for a break I worked hard it's time for a break and if you want to stay sharp sometimes it's good to take a break you have people and entrepreneurs again business owners CEOs that are working from here to there and I mean you can do that but I think the best and most important thing is invest in your health as well invest in your sleep invest in time to the masjid like your mental peace but also to not work like complete 10 hours in a day so then the next thing that do and that's between 1 p .m.
